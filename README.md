## Source Configuration

Base configuration parameters:

| ---               | ---        | ---
| `api`             | *Required* | The address of the Cloud Controller in the Cloud Foundry deployment.
| `skip_cert_check` | *Optional* | Check the validity of the CF SSL cert. Defaults to `false`.
| `org`             | *Optional* | Sets the default organization to target (can be overridden in the params config).
| `space`           | *Optional* | Sets the default space to target (can be overridden in the params config).
| `cf_color`        | *Optional* | Set to `false` to not colorize cf output (can be overridden in the params config).
| `cf_dial_timeout` | *Optional* | Max wait time to establish a connection, including name resolution, in seconds (can be overridden in the params config).
| `cf_trace`        | *Optional* | Set to `true` to print cf API request diagnostics to stdout (can be overridden in the params config).

Supported cf cli versions:

| Params            | Usage      | Description
| ---               | ---        | ---
| `cf_cli_version`  | *Optional* | The major version of the [cf cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to use. Supported values: `6`, `7`, `8` (defaults to `6`)

Authentication is supported by either using `username` and `password`:

| Params            | Usage      | Description
| ---               | ---        | ---
| `username`        | *Required* | The username used to authenticate.
| `password`        | *Required* | The password used to authenticate.
| `origin`          | *Optional* | The identity provider to be used for authentication

...or using `client_id` and `client_secret`:

| Params            | Usage      | Description
| ---               | ---        | ---
| `client_id`       | *Required* | The client id used to authenticate.
| `client_secret`   | *Required* | The client secret used to authenticate.

```yaml
resource_types:
  - name: cf-cli-resource
    type: registry-image
    source:
      repository: nulldriver/cf-cli-resource
      tag: latest

resources:
  - name: cloud-foundry
    type: cf-cli-resource
    source:
      api: https://api.example.com
      username: name@example.com
      password: my password
      cf_cli_version: 8
```

## Multiple Command Syntax

This resource is capable of running single commands in separate `put` steps:

```yaml
- put: cloud-foundry
  params:
    command: create-org
    org: myorg
- put: cloud-foundry
  params:
    command: create-space
    org: myorg
    space: myspace
```

_or_ they can be combined in a single `put` step:

```yaml
- put: cloud-foundry
  params:
    commands:
      - command: create-org
        org: myorg
      - command: create-space
        org: myorg
        space: myspace
```

And, of course, if you have your `org` and `space` defined in the `source` config, it gets even more concise:

```yaml
- put: cloud-foundry
  params:
    commands:
      - command: create-org
      - command: create-space
```

## CF_HOME

The standard way to authenticate the `cf-cli-resource` with a target Cloud Foundry environment is to either use `username` **and** `password` *or* `client_id` **and** `client_secret`, which will save a `$CF_HOME/.cf/config.json` file containing the API endpoint, and access token. For some pipeline workflows, it is necessary to authenticate using alternative methods and then supply the pre-configured `config.json` to the `cf-cli-resource`.

> See [examples/cf_home-auth/pipeline.yml](examples/cf_home-auth/pipeline.yml) for a full example

```yaml
resources:
  - name: cloud-foundry
    type: cf-cli-resource

jobs:
  - name: deploy
    plan:
      - get: my-repo
      - task: authenticate
        file: my-repo/some-script-that-authenticates-and-creates-a-cf-config-json.yml
      - put: cloud-foundry
        params:
          cf_home: authenticate-task-output
          commands:
            - command: push
              path: my-repo/myapp
              manifest: my-repo/manifest.yml
```

## Command via file input

This resource supports file inputs. This allows the pipeline to parameterize and generate commands during pipeline execution.

| Params         | Usage      | CLI Version | Description
| ---            | ---        | ---         | ---
| `command_file` | *Optional* | All         | Contains path to a YAML file that contains the same fields as `params`; including `command` or `commands`. If used, this resource uses only the configuration listed in this file. All other configurations specified in the `params` section will be ignored. The `command_file` field (if exists) is ignored within the content of the file itself.

```yaml
- task: configure
  config:
    platform: linux
    image_resource:
      type: docker-image
      source:
        repository: ubuntu
    run:
      path: bash
      args:
        - -excl
        - |-
          cat > cf_command/params.yml <<EOF
          command: delete
          app_name: myapp
          delete_mapped_routes: true
          EOF
    outputs:
      - name: cf_command
- put: cloud-foundry
  params:
    command: delete
    command_file: cf_command/params.yml
```
